### Substack Profile Finder
Python tool to filter Substack profiles by keywords (builder, founder, product, design, AI) in their bios.

**Key Features:**
- Batch process and filter URL lists by keywords
- Extract profile metadata (bio, name, subscribers)
- Export matches to JSON and CSV
- Demo mode to test functionality
- Rate limiting and ethical scraping

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo to see how it works
python demo_substack_finder.py

# Filter your own URL list
python substack_finder.py --urls-file my_substacks.txt
```

**Note:** Due to Substack's bot protection, this tool works best for filtering manually collected URL lists rather than automated discovery.
